## Challenges 

- **bcrypt** was changed to **bcryptjs** due to difficulty deploying on render. This was a techinal issue that caused little delay and rigorous debugging for us.
- Challenge with admin creation, that we need to always need to run a script each time we're adding new admin.
- Separating each admin and their students so various group can make use of the app (not solved).
